# Telecom_Ray-tacing_software

The objective of the project is to develop a simulator using the ray-tracing method to predict the power that would be picked up by a receiver connected to a base station placed at a fixed point in a zone.
The simulator also deduces the bit rate distribution and establish the area coverage of the base station.
